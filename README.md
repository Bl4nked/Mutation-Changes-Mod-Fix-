# Mutation-Changes-Mod-Fix-
Its basically Mutation Changes Mod from Peeved Penguin but fixed so it can run without problems in the newer versions. I Don't intend to steal anyone's project and will remove the link if the author wish it so. Also this is the first thing i have modded for cataclysm and i did it with the best intentions so... Please dun' kill me... :(

-Ok also something you need to be aware is that... In order to get the chimerical protection mutation, you will have to mod your the json files of your cataclysm to make it so, that all the fur/feathers/scale mutations not cancel between themselves out its not so hard if you use the search/replace commands. Reply me in the discourse to share your opinions and suggestions,or if you want me to change something or keep the mod updated. ;)
